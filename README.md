# welcome to my Todo List project
In this project I created a Todo List Web Application, in which the user can store prioritized todo tasks and view/sort the task list. All the data is saved in "JSONbin.io" so you can access it from different browsers and places and all the data Will be saved.

## Link to Github Pages

## The structure of the Todo List
At the top you can see the header and below that is the number of tasks that you currently have in your Todo List.
below that you have the input fields and a few buttons that help you manage your ToDo list.
Below that you have the list section were all of your tasks will be displayed and of course a few more buttons and fetchers.

## Features and usage
Inside the Web application you can find a variety of features that will help you manage your tasks.

### Add task
In order to add a new task you may enter the task description in the input field, choose the priority of the task from 1-5, and the category of the task (General, Work or Family).
Click on the Add button and the task will be added to your Todo List.

### Edit task
In order to edit a task all you need to do is press the Edit button that is located on the right side of the task. The selected task will be marked with a blue border, the input fields above (task description, priority and category) will inherit the data from your task. Now all you have todo is make the relevant changes in the task and confirm the changes by pressing the "Confirm Update" button that is added on the left side of the Add button.
If you wish to exit Edit mode, without saving the changes, click on the Edit button again.

### Delete task and Undo button
To delete a task all you have to do is click the Delete button on the right side of the task that you want to delete.The last delete operation can be undone. To undo your task delete, click on the Undo button that is located on the Input line.

### Drag & drop
In order to organize your list you can simply drag a task and drop it in the new location inside the Todo List.
the newest order of the list will be saved under the drag & drop sort option so you can go back to it if you like even after you closed the browser(the data is saved inside the JASONbin.io storage).

### Sorting
By default, the Sort button (that is located next to the Add button) will sort your list by priority, ascending. Using the Sort By option, you can choose to sort your Todo list by date, by category or by drag & drop. After you choose the sort option, just press the Sort button.

### Task completed
Task is completed? congratulations! Double click anywhere on the task, text color will be change to green and a strike-through line will be added to signify that the task is completed. In order to remove it from the list you can just press the Delete button and the task will be deleted.
